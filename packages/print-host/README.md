# @pcc/print-host

Private workspace package for the N144 October MVP print host. The host application
comes in later PRs. This package currently contains deterministic test support and
repros of the toolkit gaps that prevent the host from using REAL-mode IPP printing
and producing the oracle's required evidence.
Its source enters the gateway image through `COPY . .`; only the build skips it
via the Dockerfile's turbo filter.

The host must produce ONE signed bundle per settlement unit: print events plus pulled carrier
events on success, or `execution_failed` evidence on failure. The reference is
pcc-oracle's B5 print-host bundle contract (bus #7386; on the Spark:
`/mnt/sparkbulk/pcc-reconciliation/returns/pcc-oracle-work/print-host-bundle-contract-20261009.md`),
sections 3.0, 4.2 and 5. Toolkit changes belong to pcc-adk; this package records the needed
behavior without changing or working around the toolkit.

## Repros for pcc-adk

Each `GAP-n` calls the exported toolkit and asserts what the host needs. By default,
`gap(name, fn)` registers `it.fails`; a fixed gap therefore makes the expected-failure
test fail until its registration is updated. Set `PRINT_HOST_SHOW_GAPS=1` to register
ordinary tests and see the actual unmet assertions. Passing controls check a print's
success bundle, positive decimal cancel ids (and rejection of whitespace, hex, and
exponent strings), both cancel/event orders, and an Ed25519 seed scan using known
hex and base64 seeds plus a file without a seed. GAP-7 also checks that an intact
copied journal resumes alongside the requirement to refuse a tampered copy.

When a toolkit change makes a GAP test pass, the same PR changes that test's `gap(` to `it(`; the repro is then that fix's acceptance test.

| Test name | What the host called | What it needs | Toolkit lines (path:line) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GAP-1 real mode never simulates | `createIppPrintKernel({mockMode:false, uri:"ipp://127.0.0.1:9/ipp/print", kernelId, deviceId}).print({documentData, ...})` | Refuse unavailable real printing, or record no simulated or mock events. Reporting a downgrade is not enough: simulated evidence cannot settle. | `packages/kernel/src/adapters/ipp-adapter.ts:130`, `:136`, `:143`, `:432`; `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:352` |
| GAP-2 a print's evidence holds only its own job's events (N106) | Two sequential `runPrintJob` calls sharing one adapter and emitter; `emitter.getEvents(A.jobId, A.stepId)` after B | A contains none of B's events, identified by B's `ippJobId`. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:193`, `:208`; `packages/kernel/src/adapters/types.ts:59` |
| GAP-3 a reported failure returns a SIGNED execution_failed bundle | `runPrintJob` followed by adapter `execution_failed {ippJobId, state:"canceled"}` | A bundle containing failure and no completion, with a verifiable Ed25519 signature over its bundle hash. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:256`, `:269` |
| GAP-4 a timeout cancels the device job and returns a SIGNED execution_failed bundle | `runPrintJob({timeoutMs:300, ...})`; advance exactly 300 ms, then await real async work | One or more cancels, all for job 104 (never `"stop"`); keep polling to the canceled state and return a signed failure bundle with no completion, including a kernel `execution_failed {ippJobId, reason:"timeout", origin:"kernel"}`. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:230`, `:240`, `:248`; `packages/kernel/src/adapters/ipp-adapter.ts:231`, `:477-481`, `:717-725` |
| GAP-5 an abort input cancels the device job and returns a SIGNED execution_failed bundle | `runPrintJob({timeoutMs:10_000, signal, ...})`; abort jobs 105/115 under both cancel/event orders, then await real async work | One or more cancels, all for the print's own id (never `"stop"`); signed failure evidence before timeout whether state 7 arrives before or after cancellation resolves, including a kernel `execution_failed {ippJobId, reason:"aborted", origin:"kernel"}`. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:107`, `:230`, `:240`; `packages/kernel/src/adapters/ipp-adapter.ts:231`, `:717-725` |
| GAP-6 the unit fields reach every event | `runPrintJob({... settlementUnitId, challengeNonce})`, passed through a requested-option cast | Every recorded event payload commits both unit fields. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:107`, `:179`; `packages/kernel/src/evidence-emitter.ts:138`, `:192` |
| GAP-7 a unit-level evidence session signs ONE journaled bundle under a delegated session key | Dynamically find `openUnitEvidenceSession` / `resumeUnitEvidenceSession`; open with PCC `jobId`, `parentAgentId = eip155:84532:<lowercase operator>`, whole-second `fundedAt`, and `expiresAt` set to the unit's `reclaimAt`; add print events and pickup, resume, add delivery, finalize | Per pcc-evidence bus #7537 H1(b), mint and authorize the session key at finalization: bundle `jobId` equals the requested PCC job id, authorization `parentAgentId` matches the operator, `contractIds` is exactly `[jobId]`, whole-second `issuedAt` lies between `fundedAt` and the earliest event timestamp, `expiresAt` equals `reclaimAt`, and `maxSignatures` equals this ONE bundle's event count. Every event binds `settlementUnitId` and `challengeNonce`. Keep device and session seeds off disk, journal the signed bundle before return, return byte-identical repeat/resumed finalization, reject another unit and a broken journal with an intact-copy resume control, and require files mode 0600 and all journal directories mode 0700. | API absent; `packages/spec/src/evidence/signing-preimage.ts:239` |
| GAP-8 a busy refusal is reported as busy and emits no failure (N127) | `runPrintJob` after adapter refuses start with top-level `busy: true` (also retained in `data`) | Top-level `result.busy === true`; no failure evidence. | `packages/kernel/src/printer-job.ts:221`, `:228`; `packages/kernel/src/adapters/types.ts:37` |

The unit options, `signal`, top-level `busy`, and unit evidence session API are
requested toolkit shapes. Local types and dynamic lookup keep the repros compilable
before those APIs exist. GAP-7 consumes print events, never the print's success bundle.

## Running

From the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @pcc/print-host test
PRINT_HOST_SHOW_GAPS=1 pnpm --filter @pcc/print-host test
pnpm --filter @pcc/print-host typecheck
```

The second test run reports nine failures across eight gaps (GAP-5 has two orders).
Typecheck `test/` separately as well: the production tsconfig deliberately excludes
tests, and Vitest does not typecheck them.

`FakeMachineAdapter` implements the toolkit's `MachineAdapter`. Tests script each
start as success with a device job id, busy, or error; await `started()`; explicitly
`emit` print events with `ippJobId`; and inspect `commands` and `cancels`.
Its `cancelJob(jobId)` accepts positive safe integer numbers or decimal strings
matching `/^[1-9][0-9]*$/` whose numeric value is a safe integer, and records numbers.
For the active job it emits `execution_failed {ippJobId, state:"canceled"}` before
cancellation resolves, or on a later real event-loop poll with
`{cancelEventOrder:"after-resolve"}`. Other ids change nothing, and `"stop"` ends
work without a terminal event. Real-time waits let hashing finish; fake-time draining
is only a fallback. Each test uses its own
kernel and device ids. IPP repros use fake timers and dispose the adapter; the only
real-mode URI is the loopback discard endpoint above. All signing keys are generated
in memory at runtime. Signatures are verified using `@pcc/kernel-sdk` and Node's
crypto API.
